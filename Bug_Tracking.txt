	Review:
		- sent 0.0.0.256 to isValidInet4Address() in InetAddressValidator.java
		- followed step by step to review the code process
		- Found issue in file: InetAddressValidator.java line: 96
		- Reproducible: Yes --- send a iIpSegment to the isValidInet4Address() with a value of >255.
			- if (iIpSegment > 255) { return true; }
			- the return value is incorrect, this should return a false when a iIpSegment is > 255.
